Faculty Information System:
To user, it provides information regarding the cabin and contact details of faculty and also the ongoing projects in the college under that faculty. To give more specific results to students we have also implemented a filter system to filter the results. 

How to start:

under the folder "config" open "config.php". modify the database connection configuration accodingly.
Put FIS folder as document root of your web server (e.g Apache).
